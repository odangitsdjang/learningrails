Created with a goal to make a blog site to use for App Academy.

Some other things that I learned will be written in Learned.md in the root directory.

I will be using popular gems listed below to create a functional blog:

1. [devise](https://rubygems.org/gems/devise/versions/4.2.0) for authentication
2. [paperclip]() for adding image to posts
3. [gritter]() for minimalistic flash messages
4. [kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) to paginate blog posts
5. [Font Awesome Sass](https://github.com/FortAwesome/font-awesome-sass) for icons and fonts (css)

The steps I used to create this rails app is listed in StepbyStep.md
