# Basically a step by step of what I did.

1. Create rails directory, add it to GitHub, etc.

2. Set up devise; it will give you extra directions for you to do.

3. Rails scaffold up posts and comments. Set up kaminari; change posts_controller.rb appropriately (give it permissions) so that everything works properly (Rails 5.1 thing?).

4. Work on front end a little bit, deploy it to heroku. Move sqlite3 gem in Gemfile and add production gem "pg" to fix the heroku problem.

5.
